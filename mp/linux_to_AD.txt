###Linux to AD

###Method - sssd via realmd 

yum install -y realmd install krb5-workstation krb5-libs openldap-clients
realm  discover -v demo.local




###
###Default behavior: SSSD will use ID Mapping to create UID/GID from AD based SID
realm join demo.local

###go validate computer object in AD for host


realm list -v


###Test AD user account, create a new account or use the test1 account
### using putty access the host and logon using an AD account, if using the test1 AD account - in AD uncheck 'change password at next logon'
test1@demo.local   < -- AD based user: test1
Password123!
id
klist




###
###Disable ID Mapping and use AD to provide UID & GID's etc..
###When using ID mapping described in Automatically generate new UIDs and GIDs for AD users, SSSD creates new UIDs and GIDs, which overrides the values defined in AD. To keep the AD-defined values, you must disable ID mapping in SSSD.
realm join --automatic-id-mapping=no  demo.local 

###go validate computer object in AD for host


###Add unix attributes for user in AD;  uidNumber, gidNumber, unixHomeDirectory, or loginShell  + create group and add GID

uidNumber 123456
gidNumber 123456
unixHomeDirectory /home/<username>
loginShell /bin/bash



###Test AD user account, create a new account or use the test1 account
### using putty access the host and logon using an AD account, if using the test1 AD account - in AD uncheck 'change password at next logon'
test1@demo.local   < -- AD based user: test1
Password123!
id
klist




###
How to Disable ID Mapping in SSSD
	1. Open the /etc/sssd/sssd.conf file.
	2. In the AD domain section, add the ldap_id_mapping = false setting.
Note
If you used the realm utility to join the domain and added the --automatic-id-mapping=no switch, the realm utility already set up SSSD with ldap_id_mapping = false.
	3. If you previously requested any users with the default ID mapping configuration, remove the SSSD caches:  rm -f /var/lib/sss/db/*
SSSD will now use POSIX attributes from AD, instead of creating them locally.
