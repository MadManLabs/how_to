###Linux to AD

###Method - sssd via realmd  against the AD demo.local
### on all hosts install the REALM librabries
yum install -y realmd install krb5-workstation krb5-libs openldap-clients sssd samba-common-tools
realm  discover -v demo.local




###
###
Option1 - on host hdfs2 --- 192.168.1.41
Default behavior: SSSD will use ID Mapping to create UID/GID from AD based SID  
realm join demo.local
realm list -v


Password123!   < -- password for the AD join

###go validate computer object in AD for host, hdfs2 host now joined to AD

In AD add new user - test1 Password123!  - uncheck 'must change password' 


###Test AD user account
### using putty access the host and logon using an AD account


putty to 192.168.1.41
test1@demo.local   < -- AD based user: test1
Password123!

id
klist

or
su - test1@demo.local
Password123!
id


Option1:
-uid/gid hashed from SID in AD for users, not stored in AD attributes but same on all linux host for this account
-why is this bad for us
-What can we do






Option2 on host hdfs3 192.168.1.42
###
###Disable ID Mapping and use AD to provide UID & GID's etc..
###When using ID mapping described in Automatically generate new UIDs and GIDs for AD users, SSSD creates new UIDs and GIDs, which overrides 
###the values defined in AD. To keep the AD-defined values, you must disable ID mapping in SSSD.

###on hdfs3
realm join --automatic-id-mapping=no  demo.local 

###go validate computer object in AD for host

Enable Advanced Features from View in AD

In AD add new user - test2 Password123!  - uncheck 'must change password' 
###Add unix attributes for user in AD;  uidNumber, gidNumber, unixHomeDirectory, or loginShell  + create group and add GID

Go to user properties, Attribute Editor and add:

uidNumber 123456
gidNumber 123456
unixHomeDirectory /home/test2
loginShell /bin/bash

create test2grp group in AD and assign GID
gidNumber 123456



###Test AD user account
### using putty access the host and logon using an AD account

putty to 192.168.1.42
test2@demo.local   < -- AD based user: test2
Password123!
id
klist

or
su - test2@demo.local
Password123!
id
klist ? why no krb ticket
kinit
klist

option1 - auto assign ID from Hash
option2 - use ID's from AD attributes


extra bonus -- how does isilon see these AD based used users!


###validate AD setup
isi auth ads view DEMO.LOCAL -v

###enable AD-rfc2307 attributes
isi auth ads modify DEMO.LOCAL --sfu-support=rfc2307
isi auth ads view DEMO.LOCAL -v

###test option1 user - no AD attributes defined, linux UID HASH based, what UID does Isilon assign and why?
isi auth mapping token --zone=System --user=DEMO\\test1

###test option2 user - AD has attributes defined, linux uses AD ID's, what UID does Isilon assign and why?
isi auth mapping token --zone=System --user=DEMO\\test2

How to Disable ID Mapping in SSSD
	1. Open the /etc/sssd/sssd.conf file.
	2. In the AD domain section, add the ldap_id_mapping = false setting.
Note
If you used the realm utility to join the domain and added the --automatic-id-mapping=no switch, the realm utility already set up SSSD with ldap_id_mapping = false.
	3. If you previously requested any users with the default ID mapping configuration, remove the SSSD caches:  rm -f /var/lib/sss/db/*
SSSD will now use POSIX attributes from AD, instead of creating them locally.
